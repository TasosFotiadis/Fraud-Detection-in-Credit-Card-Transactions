# Fraud-Detection-in-Credit-Card-Transactions
Our aim in this project is to detect fraudulent transactions from a stream of bank transaction data. Each transaction will be classified in the end as a binary statement (either 0 for legit or 1 for fraud). Our focus is on building a reliable and interpretable detection model using publicly available transaction data using different ML models.
